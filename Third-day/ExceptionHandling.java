// Write a program to demonstrate the concept of exception handling in Java using try, catch, and finally blocks.

/*
Steps for handling exception in java
Step 1: Identify the code that may throw an exception and wrap it in a try block.
Step 2: Catch the exception using a catch block that follows the try block.
Step 3: Handle the exception in the catch block, such as printing an error message or taking corrective action.
Step 4: Optionally, use a finally block to execute code regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

/*
Note: At a time we can handle more than 1 exception
Scenario :
1) We are developing a software for a banking application. 
In this application, we can have various operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, 
and transferring money between accounts. Each of these operations can potentially throw different 
types of exceptions,
such as InsufficientFundsException, AccountNotFoundException, and InvalidAmountException.

Real world ex of finally with try catch block
2) We are developing a software for a file processing application.
In this application, we can have various operations such as reading a file,
 writing to a file, and closing a file.
Each of these operations can potentially throw different types of exceptions,
such as FileNotFoundException, IOException, and SecurityException.
In this scenario, we can use a finally block to ensure that the file is always closed,
regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. This way, we can prevent resource leaks
and ensure that the application runs smoothly.
